    Adds a new ``comparison_ideal`` argument, which can help indicate if it is desired
    that a stat has gone up or down, or stayed the same. Prior, there was an assumption
    that all stats should go up. Defaults to "higher" to preserve old behavior, and
    because in the general case most metrics are positively oriented.
