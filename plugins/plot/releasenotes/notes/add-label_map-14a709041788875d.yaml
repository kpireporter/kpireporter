features:
  - |
    Plots now support a ``label_map`` option, which maps series names (column
    names) to some text value. This can be used to make nicer, more readable
    legends.
  - |
    The Plot class now defines a ``post_plot`` function. This is called directly
    after running most of the plot logic, but before rendering the final output.
    It is a good place to modify legends or add additional presentation to the
    plot output. The intention is that a plugin could subclass Plot and provide
    some additional hooks here.
