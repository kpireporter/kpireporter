    A new ``precision`` argument is available to allow you to define the displayed
    precision of the stat. Precision defaults to 0, meaning the stat is rounded to
    the nearest integer.

    Query results that return multiple rows are columns now have some attempted support.
    If there are columns, the first column is summed and displayed. If there is only
    an index, but it contains multiple rows, the rows are summed.
