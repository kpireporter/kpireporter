    Any view that supports the Slack output format can now return a Slack Block
    structure instead of a mrkdwn string. If a Block or a list of Blocks is returned
    from ``render_slack``, they are added to the existing list of Blocks that make
    up the report. Views are still demarcated by divider blocks.

    The render function can either return a Block object assembled via the Slack SDK,
    or it can return a dict, which must adhere to the Block specification.

    This release requires later versions of KPI Reporter core, which drop the constraint
    that View output must be a string.
