    Plugin template resolution now supports walking up class hierachies. If a concrete
    class extends an existing plugin, templates will be first searched for in the
    concrete class' module, then its parent class, and so on. Before, only the concrete
    class and the base View module were included in the lookup paths, so parent class
    templates would be ignored.
